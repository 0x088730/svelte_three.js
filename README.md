**It makes no sense to install / download the package now** as it contains only placeholder content at the moment. Please be patient and feel free to check out the **early demos** (see below) which will be **updated frequently during the development**, there's a new **new interaction demo** (see below). 

Due to some unpredictable and unavoidable schedule changes, the first release (previously planed for June 2020) is going to ship as soon as possible somewhere in **July 2020**!

Thank you for your interest and patience! ðŸ™‚
