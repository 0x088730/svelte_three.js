### 😎 stay tuned, coming June 2020 ... 🚀

**It should make no sense to install / download the package now** as it contains only basic dependencies / build setup at the moment. Please be patient and feel free to check out the **early demo** (see below) which will be **updated frequently during the development**. First release is planed for June 2020. Thank you! 🙂
